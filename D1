    Foundations of DE
        - moving one place to another
        - life cycle: Generation->ingestion->transformation->serving
    ETL(extract, transform, load) VS ELT(extract, load, transform)
        - history: mahal storage before kaya tinitipid (ELT), now ETL lahat iniistore, para eventuallly lahat kaya balikan
    DLT (data load tool)
        - most popular production ready python lib
    CLickhouse
        - ex of database(stores data)
    OLPT 
        - records row by row
        - fast for inserts/upd 
    OLAP
        - records by column
        - slower writes, optimized for reads
    3 stage pipeline
        1. start with the raw data
        2. clean (identify if data is stadard, missing values, etc)
        3. move to mart
    DBT (data build tool)
        - use for transforming

## Hands on experiences
        - I got to familiarized myself with 4 new application;
                WSL (ubuntu)
                docker
                git
                dbeaver
        - Connect to a database (clickhouse)
        - Raw-> Clean-> Mart Pipeline
        - i find metabase fun

### Personal take
      I felt really overwhelmed by the apps since I had no background at all. I did not know what they were for or how to use them.
It felt like I was behind everyone else and that made me feel a bit pressured.

#### For next session
         - try to list the step by step process when doing a hands-on task
